redux is build on top of functional programming principle so we can't directly modify
or mutate the store.
store is an immutable object so to update it we create a function which takes store as
an argument and return the updated store that function is called reducer

function reducer(store){
    // return updated store here we can use spread operator or immutable libraries to copy
}

so to know the reducer what property we need to update on our store we have actions

function reducer(store, actions){
    const updated = {..store};
    updated.products = ???
}

Redux has 3 building blocks - 
Action(event) [dispatch] -> Store -> Reducer(event handler)
                                  <-

Steps - 
1.Design the store
2.Define the actions
3.Create a reducer
4.Set up the store
